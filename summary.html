		<h1>Summary of The Shallows</h1>
<div class="summary">
	<p>	This book starts with a quote from 2001: A Space Odyssey, with the super computer, HAL, having emotions
and being audibly sad, although it's a machine. The author, Nicholas Carr, speaks on his own experience as well as other anecdotes
speaking on how ever since the Internet has dominated the new world, reading and being concentrated on things for long periods of time
had been more difficult. Carr noticed this change, and wondered what exactly was causing it, prompting him to write an essay about
his experiences, titled, Is Google Making Us Stupid? His success in the essay led him to research more on the cause, which leads to this book.
The next three chapters lay the foundation for his main points, with him explaining the orgin of written language, how books became more
commonplace throughout the centuries, and even debunking the popular theory that the brain doesn't change once it reaches adulthood. These chapters
give the reader a basement of ideas by Carr that are used to help understand and explain the chapters later on, as Carr will callback to these
ideas and beliefs. Chapter four onwards, Carr then talks about his main point more, explaining Google and its harmful implications, the 
countless studies proving that computers do not improve human cognition or communication. Carr disproves a common argument that the information 
suppied by the internet outweighs its potential consequences, by citing multiple studies of people having more trouble researching with technology and 
people learning less with more research at hand. Carr also goes furthur with this by showing that people can't intake everything the Internet bombards
in our faces, with research showing that people learn less with more "advanced software" and they can't recall as much information from screen as from a book.
Carr starts to wrap up the book by explaining the chokehold the internet has on us, and how sometimes, depending on conditions, it is impossible to let it go.</p>
		<h3>My Personal Review</h3>
	<p2>I found this book interesting, but a bit underwhelming and lacking. Starting with the positives, I appreciate the heavily cited sources as evidence as it does influence
the book, as was said by Carr himself (pg.153). I also liked how, for the time, this book was most likely quite influential as it gave a new idea with heavy evidence
to a growing world. The last thing I can say that was good was the chapter names, I thought they were awesome (specifically "The Church of Google"). That's about it
unfortuantely. My biggest crititism was that the book had too much fluff that didn't add anything to the book itself. For example, chapters three and four speak on the origin 
of books and writing, respectively. However, these chapters have little to no importance, as they barely get mentioned in later chapters, and I fail to see how it was useful in
giving a reference for Carr's later points. I counted the references or callbacks from those chapters in later chapters, and I counted three times chapters three and four were
referenced in the next seven chapters. If you skipped those two chapters, nothing would be lost. Now, chapter two also explains the origins and advancement of something, specifically
neuroplasticity. However, if you skipped that chapter, the rest of the book would be abysmal to read through, as many points and beliefs were explained in chapter two, and were continuously
brought up again. Another crititism I had was that the book didn't go as deep as I would've liked. In order to get a reader to understand and believe your point, you give them evidence, and a 
reason why. If I'm convincing somebody that someone else was lying, just saying that they are lying because they are not looking me in the eyes and fidgeting is not a good way to convince others.
How you convince someone is you give them a reason why they are lying. By saying that they are lying because they get this gain from it, it a much easier and more believable way to convince someone.
The same applies to this book. As a persuasvive piece, Carr should've not just given loads and loads of studies, but also have given a reason as to WHY the internet would do this. He never does. 
The closest he gets is subtle lines speaking on how it's for profit, when that is quite obviously not the only reason. He gets very close to connecting the dots as to why the internet would make us
stupider, but never makes the connection. Not a crititism, but something I wanted to point out, which does help his points in this book, is a anecdote Carr shares himself. In "a digression: on the writing 
of this book," he shares how he was able to write this book. He and his wife moved to the mountains of Colorado, and cut themselves off from the internet, to which Carr could feel his attention span
gaining back, and his ability to focus better. However, he ends the bit with saying how he has slowly gone back to technology and the internet, "As for me, I'm already backsliding. (pg.200)
This quote hit me really hard, as it shows that even with disconnecting, the internet is fierce and doesn't let go easily, and nobody can truly escape it. Carr also had the option to escape, many who live in 
urbam areas or have to use electronics for their job, they are forcefully subject to the internet, unable to leave. It gave an extremely cynical moment that this book was missing, and that quote gave me
a new look on the book itself, as I realize that this internet isn't just a thing from the 2000's, and that I am living through the same internet, except worse. It also gives a fact into that Carr's book 
released 17 years ago, and yet things have only gotten worse. As I read the book, I would realize that although this is interesting, I would never sacrifice my computer or my nice technology, and I realize
as I thought that, that I fall to the same loop that catches everybody, and that I can't excape the loop even when faced with mounds of evidence and even believing it.</p2>
